# Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks using Python üêç :
 - In this project we'll Implement the basic functions of the `Gradient Descent algorithm` to find the boundary in a small dataset.
 - We tried in this notebook to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data.
 - Notebook realised with the help of udacity courses.
