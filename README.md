 - We tried in this notebook to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data.
   - GRE Scores (Test)
   - GPA Scores (Grades)
   - Class rank (1-4)
# `General overview` 🕊️ :
 - 👣 Here are the steps we followed in this notebook :
   - Loading the data.
   - Plotting the data.
   - One-hot encoding the input variable we are interested in.
   - Scalling the data.
   - Splitting the data into Training and Testing.
   - Splitting the data into features and targets (labels).
   - Training the 1-layer Neural Network.
   - Calculating the Accuracy on the Test Data.
 - 📊 The dataset used is provided in this repository.
 - 🙌 This notebook realised with the help of [udacity courses](https://www.udacity.com/).
