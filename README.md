# `Predicting Student Admissions` with Neural Networks using Python 🐍 :
 - We tried in this notebook to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data.
   - GRE Scores (Test)
   - GPA Scores (Grades)
   - Class rank (1-4)
 - 📊 The dataset used is provided in this repository.
